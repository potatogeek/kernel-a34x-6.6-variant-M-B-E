	  Support for the CPUFreq HW driver.
	  Some MediaTek chipsets have a HW engine to offload the steps
	  necessary for changing the frequency of the CPUs. Firmware loaded
	  in this engine exposes a programming interface to the OS.
	  The driver implements the cpufreq interface for this HW engine.
	  Say Y if you want to support CPUFreq HW.

	  This driver supports API to limit CPU frequency.

config CPU_FREQ_LTL_LIMIT
	bool "CPU frequency little limit API"
	help
	  This driver supports API to limit CPU frequency.
